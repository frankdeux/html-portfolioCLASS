        <h2>Serving it:</h2>
            <p>Once the sandwich is built, you can serve it whole or cut it in half. It's a big sandwich, so cutting it in half is recommended. 
               It's a very versatile sandwich that can be served with many different sides, 
               but traditionally it is eaten on it's own or if you think it won't be enough; make a second one =) .</p>
