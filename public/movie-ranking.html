    <h3>1. Ocean's 11</h3>
        <p>I like the underhanded comedy wrappeed up in action and drama.</p>

    <h3>2. Austin Powers: Goldmember</h3>
        <p>Just a silly movie with easy comedy that is entertaining and a great distraction.</p>

    <h3>3. Devil Wears Prada</h3>
        <p>Guilty pleasure chick-flick.</p>
