<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Mexican born and Atlanta raised, I worked in hospitality for 20 years. I spent a few years in sales figuring out 
  exactly the next path in my career. I decided to take a leap of faith and learn how to code and working as a manual
  QA engineer in the meantime.
</p>

<p>I have a beautiful wife and 2 year old son that keeps us busy and tired! I'm too tired to elaborate.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to my future in tech and I think this is the best for form my logical way of thinking and 
  relentless need to problem solve. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
